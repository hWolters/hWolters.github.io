      <description>You have built a great streamlit app. So far, you only ran it locally on your computer on localhost:8501. Now you would like to share your app with others, but wonder how. This blogpost introduces you to one option: Heroku. Heroku is a platform as a service that allows you to deploy your apps (not just streamlit apps, but also jvm apps, ruby apps etc.). This post will guide you through the deployment of a streamlit app on Heroku.</description>
