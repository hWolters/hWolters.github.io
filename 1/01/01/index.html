<p>So many people have recommended git as a version control system to me. I had a look at it, but I was pretty overwhelmed. This thing seemed so complex! Eventhough there are tons of tutorials, I felt lost. Many tutorials let me copy paste code without giving you a deeper understanding of what and why I am actually doing this. This copy pasting feels like success at first, but when I tried working with it, I could not.</p>
<p>The goal of this post is to teach you everything you need to know about git on how use it as your version control system. Weâ€™re not going to talk about collaboration with git so far. First you need to understand some basic things.</p>
<p>Git works with <strong>repositories</strong>. A repository is a folder, that contains a <code>.git</code> file.</p>
<p>In git there are several directories where you save your code:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Working directory</strong>: This is where you save your files on your local file system</li>
<li><strong>Stating Area (a.k.a. Index)</strong>: This is basically temporary memory. You can use this to save a file, that is not done, yet, but you reached a point where you feel the need to save something.</li>
<li><strong>Local repo</strong>: This is a local copy of the repo. Everything you save there, will show up in your history.</li>
<li><strong>Upstream repo</strong>: This is a remote copy of a repo. So this is not on your computer, but saved for example on github or gitlab.</li>
</ul>
