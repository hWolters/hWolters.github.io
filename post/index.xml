      <description>So you&amp;rsquo;re working with a Hive database and you would like to query some values. Then you&amp;rsquo;re notice: &amp;ldquo;This value I need is trapped in this column among other values&amp;hellip; How do I get it out?!&amp;rdquo; Congratulations, you just came across a complex a.k.a. nested datatype in Hive. The idea of complex datatypes is to store multiple values in a single column. There are three types: arrays, maps and structs. First, you first have to understand, which types are present.</description>

      <description>So many people have recommended Git as a version control system to me. I had a look at it, but I was pretty overwhelmed. Since I did not have a technical background, everything seemed so complex! Many tutorials let me copy paste code without giving you a deeper understanding of what and why I am actually doing this. This copy pasting feels like success at first, but when I tried working with it, I could not.</description>

      <description>This post is about how to change your R working directory. You might be wondering:

  The basics: the R package kableExtra kableExtra is an awesome package that allows you to format and style your tables. It works similar to ggplot2: You create a base table and then add formating layers with the pipe operator %&amp;gt;%.</description>
