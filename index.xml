      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post will teach you the inution of REST APIs and how you can use them to get interesting datasets for your data projects. First, we will look at the four components of a request. In the second part of this blogpost, we will go through one example and access the coingecko API via &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pointwise, Pairswise and Listwise Learning to Rank Models - Three Approaches to Optimize Relative Ordering</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In many scenarios, such as a google search or a product recommendation in an online shop, we have tons of data and limited space to display it. We cannot show all the products of an online shop to the user as a possible next best offer. Neither would a user want to scroll through all the pages indexed by a search engine to find the most relevant page that matches his search keywords. The most relevant content should be on top. Learning to rank (LTR) models are supervised machine learning models that attempt to optimize the order of items. So compared to classification or regression models, they do not care about exact scores or predictions, but the relative order. LTR models are typically applied in search engines, but gained popularity in other fields such as product recommendations as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I was recently invited to join a panel discussion among developers to dispel the myth of the typical BS Buzzword Bingo around machine learning and AI. In this blog post, I will share some buzzwords we talked about with a little description and links. Ooops, I already used some buzzwords. So let&amp;rsquo;s start.
AI (Artificial Intelligence) is the magic portion to fix all problems of all companies and will make us unemployed in the future.</description>

      <title>The Intuition of Word Embeddings: How you Teach A Computer to Understand Text</title>

      <description>Humans intuitively understand the meaning of words: Which words are similar, opposites or related to each other? But our machine learning models do not have this intuition. Word embeddings are numeric vectors that represent text. These vectors are learned through neural networks. The objective when creating these embedding vectors is to capture as much &amp;ldquo;meaning&amp;rdquo; as possible: Related words should be closer together than unrelated words. Also, they should be able to preserve mathematical relationships between words such as</description>

      <description>In this blogpost I will share some tips for working with Jupyter Notebooks. Those tips greatly improved my productivity when working with Jupyter Notebooks and I wish someone would have told me earlier. The two main topics of this post are extensions and magic commands.
Jupyter Extensions Have you ever missed a feature in your Jupyter Notebook that IDEs have? E.g. you were hoping for autocompletion or automatically formatting code? Then there might be a Jupyter Notebook extension for you.</description>

      <title>Mastering ElasticSearch Queries If You Have Only Worked With SQL Before</title>

      <description>Elasticsearch is often the storage engine of choice for storing and querying full text data. But writing an ElasticSearch query is pretty different compared to querying a relational database in SQL. In this blogpost, you will learn some basics you need to understand before working with ElasticSearch. In the second part, you learn how to write queries in ElasticSearch.Â ElasticSearch uses many of the same concepts as your SQL Database. The terminology is just a little different.</description>

      <title>How the Inverted Index and Scoring Work in ElasticSearch</title>

      <description>Searching through full text fields with regexes in relational database systems like PostgreSQL or MySQL is painful: The query latency is high and your results will be unordered, so you have no idea how relevant your query results are. Elasticsearch is often the storage engine of choice for storing and querying full text data. In ElasticSearch querying fulltext fields is among the least resource intensive tasks and your query results are ordered putting the most relevant results on top.</description>

      <title>Working with Complex Datatypes in Hive</title>

      <guid>/2020/06/07/working-with-complex-datatypes-in-hive/</guid>
      <description>table { width:80% !important;}  The basic idea of complex datatypes is to store multiple values in a single column. So if you are working with a Hive database and you query a column, but then you notice &amp;ldquo;This value I need is trapped in a column among other values&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; you just came across a complex a.k.a. nested datatype.
There are three types: arrays, maps and structs. First, you have to understand, which types are present.</description>

      <title>Plotting with Seaborn</title>

      <guid>/2019/09/10/plotting-with-seaborn/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Seaborn is a python library for creating plots. It is based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://matplotlib.org&#34;&gt;matplotlib &lt;/a&gt; and provides a high-level interface for drawing statistical graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seaborn integrates nicely with pandas: It operates on DataFrames and arrays and does aggregations and semantic mapping automatically, which makes it a quick, convenient option for data visualization in your data projects. One you understand the basic concepts, you can create plots really easily without using stack overflow too much.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>table { width:80% !important;}  When I started working with pandas I noticed that there were so many ways how to subset, filter and join data with pandas. But I was lacking a systematic overview. How do the different approaches differ and when to use which?
In this blogpost we&amp;rsquo;ll look at different ways for subsetting, filtering and combining DataFrames.

      <description>So many people have recommended Git as a version control system to me. I had a look at it, but I was pretty overwhelmed. Since I did not have a technical background, everything seemed so complex! Many tutorials let me copy paste code without giving you a deeper understanding of what and why I am actually doing this. This copy pasting feels like success at first, but when I tried working with it, I could not.</description>

      <title>Automatically changing the R working directory on Mac OS to source file location</title>

      <description>This post is about how to change your R working directory. You might be wondering:
Why would I want to do that? You need this as soon as your script interacts with folders on your computer. For example for imports or exports of data or figures. So probably almost always. Let&#39;s say you have a script that creates plots and saves them in the folder &amp;quot;Plots&amp;quot;, which is located in your source file directory.</description>

      <description>In this post, I will show you some of my best practises for formatting tables in R Markdown. We will cover
How to generally format tables (font, size, color... )
 How to create tables with conditional formating (e.g. coloring values &amp;lt; 0 red)
  The basics: the R package kableExtra kableExtra is an awesome package that allows you to format and style your tables. It works similar to ggplot2: You create a base table and then add formating layers with the pipe operator %&amp;gt;%.</description>

      <description>I write this blogpost for someone, who has never worked with R Markdown. After you read this post, you will
understand why R Markdown may be useful for your daily work as a student, researcher, analyst or data scientist.
 understand the basic structure of an R Markdown document and how you can get startet.
  I strongly encourage everybody working with R to use R Markdown. I promise, it will make your life so much easier.</description>
