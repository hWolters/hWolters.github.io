In this post I will show you some of my best practises for using R Markdown for reporting. We will cover

1. how to insert inline code.

2. how to create beautiful tables.

3. how to insert figures

4. use global variables


# Insert plots & figures

You can easily insert the figures that are created with R code. Just write R code within your code chunls, that creates a plot. R Markdown will insert your plot at right where you inserted it.


````r
`r ''````{r firstPlot}
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist)
```
````
```{r firstPlot2, echo = FALSE}
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist)
```

As explained in my previous post, you use of the options for code chunks to alter the output. This workds for figures as well. Most figure options start with `fig.`. For example, you can change the  size (`fig.height, fig.width` (default size = 7 inches), the alignment `fig.align` ("left","right","center") and the caption (`fig.cap`) of your plot.

Let's create a plot that with a wide plot, which is aligned left and give it a caption.
 
 ````r
`r ''````{r myWidePlot, fig.height = 4, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "my wide plot"}
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist)
```
````
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "my wide plot"}
plot(cars$speed, cars$dist)
```



You can also insert figures, images, gifs, that you saved on your desktop or from the internet. The brackets are optional, if you want a title for the figure. Paste the path to the image into the braces.
