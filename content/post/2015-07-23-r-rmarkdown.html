<p>I write this blogpost for someone, who has never worked with R Markdown. After you read this post, you will</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>understand why R Markdown may be useful for your daily work as a student, researcher, analyst or data scientist.</p></li>
<li><p>understand the basic structure of an R Markdown document and how you can get startet.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>I strongly encourage everybody working with R to use R Markdown. I promise, it will make your life so much easier. Here are some examples when R Markdown can be very useful:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Results sharing:</strong> You just did a great analysis and want to share your results with your team. Then you start copy pasting your Output into Excel, Word or PowerPoint. Don’t do that! It takes so much time and you might forget to copy paste the most curret version of a plot or an analysis. R Markdown can automatically convert your results to many formats such as html, word and pdf. No more copy pasting necessary! This will not only save you lot’s of time, it is also less error prone: With R Markdown, everything is up to date automatically!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Data exploration</strong> You are looking at various summary statistics and plots to understand your data. Without R Markdown, you might scroll through your console and use the back and forward button in the R Studio Viewer. This is cumbersome! You can use R Markdown like a Notebook and see multiple output tables and plots without having to use the RStudio Viewer back buttons. At the same time, you can see the code, that produced the plot. Which brings me to my next point.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Replicable Analyses:</strong> In general, all your results should be repoducible. If you just save a plot or a result, do you know exaclty which steps you needed? If you’re a really organized person, this might be possible with naming conventions. But again, R Markdown can make your life so much easier: You can save your results (e.g. a plot or a table) and the code that created it, in one file.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Automated reports:</strong> With R Markdown, you can automate analyses that need to be consistent and in the same format everytime.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>So how does it work?</h3>
<p>In an R Markdown File (.RMD) you can combine <strong>R code chunks</strong> and <strong>text</strong> (which is written in a Markdown language. More in a second!). Your R code will be excecuted and your results will be displayed. Everything is “knitted”&quot; together to a Markdown format, which can be converted into almost any format through Pandoc. The outputfile may contain your code, descriptions (executed Markdown) and the R output (tables, plots, numbers…). This may sound complicated. But all you have to do is write this file, choose your output format and press the “Knit” button in R studio.</p>
<p>Sounds magical? Let’s create your first R Markdown file in R Studio. I encourage you to use R Studio, because it provides a lot of awesomefeatures which simplify working with R Markdown.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Go to File –&gt; New File –&gt; R Markdown.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose a Title. It does not matter and can be changed easily afterwards</p></li>
<li><p>Choose your desired output (Word, Pdf…) format. Let’s choose html as a start!</p></li>
</ol>
<p>4.(Maybe do you need to install additional packages, R Markdown will tell you which)</p>
<p>There is your first R Markdown file. It already contains a little code. In fact, there are 3 different kind of code:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>YAML Header</li>
<li>Markdown</li>
<li>R Code Chunks</li>
</ol>
<p>If you press the “Knit” button, you see, that this runs perfectly and creates an output file. Let’s look at the 3 different kinds of code in your R Markdown example file.</p>
</div>
<div id="yaml-header" class="section level3">
<h3>YAML Header</h3>
<p>The header is on top of every .RMD file. The code is enclosed with 3 dashes. Your Header contains meta data about your .RMD File, such as the author, date and output format. You can add additional stuff such as gloabal variables. But don’t worry about your header too much for now. Let it just be there.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>--- 
title: &quot;My first R Markdown document&quot;
author: &quot;Heike W&quot;
date: &#39;2018-11-05&#39;
output: html_document
---</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="markdown-text" class="section level3">
<h3>Markdown (Text)</h3>
<p>Markdown is a simple textformatting language. Similar to HTML or Latex, you write plain text. Punctuation characters indicate the formating. For example a <code>#header1</code> indicates a header on the top level. You can make you text italic by enclosing it in 2 asterisk (<code>*italic*</code>). If you have never worked with HTML, Latex or Markdown before, this may appear strange to you: Your text appears to have no format and you cannot see how your formatting looks like until you compile the document. The good thing is that you can be sure, that a header level 1 is a header level 1 and all header level 1 will look the same in the final document. Here is an overview of the most common formating:</p>

<div id="r-code-chunks" class="section level3">
<h3>R Code Chunks</h3>
<p>You can write any code, you would normally write in R in R Markdown. R code chunks are enclosed with 3 apostrophies, followed by curly braces. You can simply type <em>command-option-I</em> on the Mac and <em>Ctrl-Alt-I</em> on Windows to create a new code chunk. Per default, R will execute this code chunk and display the code and the results.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>```{r headCars}
summary(cars)
```</code></pre>
<p>Click on the little green triange in the right corner of your code chunk and only this chunk will run. You can see, that the results are shown directly below the code.</p>
<p>Within the curly braces, you can name your code chunk. I named our first code chunk “headCars”. In addition, you pass options, what R should do with the code. For example you can tell R to only show the results without the code by passing the option <code>echo = FALSE</code> like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>```{r headCars, echo = FALSE}
summary(cars)
```</code></pre>
<p>Or you can tell R to skip this code chunk by setting <code>eval = FALSE</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>```{r headCars, eval = FALSE}
summary(cars)
```</code></pre>
<p>Here is a brief overview of the options, I use the most.</p>
<table style="width:100%;">
<colgroup>
<col width="40%" />
<col width="36%" />
<col width="22%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>How should the output look like?</th>
<th>How to change the parameter</th>
<th>Default option?</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>include code</td>
<td>echo = TRUE</td>
<td>yes</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>automatically format code</td>
<td>tidy = TRUE</td>
<td>no</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>do not execute code</td>
<td>eval = FALSE</td>
<td>no</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>execute code, but show nothing</td>
<td>include = FALSE</td>
<td>no</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>do not show any warnings</td>
<td>warings = FALSE</td>
<td>no</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>do not show any errors</td>
<td>error = FALSE</td>
<td>no</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<p>I hope this blogposts helps you to understand why you should use R Markdown and how to get startet. In the next blogpost, I will go into more detail how you can work with R Markdown.</p>
